# Loch-arithm

## THE BEGINNING
History is comprised of moments that defined us; the rise of agriculture, the fall of the Roman Empire, 
the burning of the library of Alexandria, and so on. Today, a new moment to be etched into the history books 
is upon us: **the founding of Loch-arithm**.

## THE IDEA
*LeetCode*-like programmatic problem solving software, serving as a semi-replacement for Moodle problem sets 
(e.g., a substitute for PA coding problem sets).
